FUNDAMENTAL DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH

Fundamental doctrines of the church encompass core Christian beliefs. Central to these are the nature of God as a Trinity, the divinity and humanity of Jesus Christ, and salvation through His atoning sacrifice. The Bible is considered the inspired Word of God, and the Holy Spirit guides believers. The church is seen as the body of Christ, called to spread the gospel. Finally, the doctrine of last things includes Jesus' return, resurrection, and eternal life or judgment. This assignment explores the Fundamental doctrines of the Church. These truths, derived from careful study and interpretation of the Bible, encompass key aspects of Christian faith. The following points explains the doctrines of the church in detail.
1.	One True God:
The Church affirms belief in one God who eternally exists in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. As said in Deuteronomy 6:4 - "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one" - This emphasizes that there is only one God. "Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit" - Matthew 28:19 - This verse mentions all three persons of the Trinity together. Here's a breakdown in even simpler terms:
	Unity of God: There is only one God. As the verse says: "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one." (Deuteronomy 6:4)
	Trinity in the New Testament: The New Testament clearly presents Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as one God. As the verse says: "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." (Matthew 28:19)
	Deity of the Father: God the Father is clearly presented as divine. As the verse says: "Yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live." (1 Corinthians 8:6)
	Deity of the Son (Jesus): Jesus Christ is fully God. As the verse says: "For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form." (Colossians 2:9)
	Deity of the Holy Spirit: The Holy Spirit is also fully God. As the verse says: "Don't you know that you yourselves are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in your midst?" (1 Corinthians 3:16)
	Distinct Persons Yet One: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct persons but one God. As the verse says: "And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever— the Spirit of truth." (John 14:16-17)

2.	The Deity of Jesus Christ:
This doctrine affirms that Jesus Christ is fully God and fully human, the eternal Son of God incarnate. The Church teaches that Jesus, while maintaining His full deity, took on human nature through the virgin birth. He lived a sinless life, performed miracles, died on the cross as an atoning sacrifice for sin, bodily rose from the dead, ascended to heaven, and will return again in power and glory. Here's a breakdown in even simpler terms: 
	Incarnation: The eternal Son of God took on human nature, becoming fully human while remaining fully divine. As said in John 1:1-2: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning." and in John 1:14: "The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us." As quoted in Philippians 2:6-7: "Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness."
	Virgin Birth: Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary, emphasizing both His divinity and humanity. As mentioned in the verse Luke 1:35: "The angel answered, 'The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God.'"
	Sinless Life: Jesus lived a perfect, sinless life, which was necessary for Him to be the spotless sacrifice for sin. As said in Hebrews 4:15: "For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin." Jesus never sinned although he was tempted in every way,
	Divine Attributes: Jesus demonstrated attributes that belong only to God, such as:
	Omniscience (all-knowing): John 2:24-25: "But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, for he knew all people. He did not need any testimony about mankind, for he knew what was in each person."
	Omnipotence (all-powerful): Matthew 28:18: "Then Jesus came to them and said, 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.'"
	Ability to forgive sins: Mark 2:5-7: "When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, 'Son, your sins are forgiven.' Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves, 'Why does this fellow talk like that? He's blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?'"

3.	Salvation:
Salvation is the central message of Christianity, referring to God's deliverance of humanity from sin and its consequences. Salvation is understood as a free gift from God, received through faith in Jesus Christ, and involves forgiveness of sins, reconciliation with God, and the promise of eternal life. Let's break this down into key aspects:
	Need for Salvation: All humans are sinners and in need of salvation due to the fall of humanity. As the verse says in Romans 3:23: "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
	God's Initiative: Salvation originates with God's love and grace, not human effort. One of the important verse in the bible mentions this in John 3:16: "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."
	The Work of Christ: Salvation is made possible through Jesus Christ's death and resurrection. The verse says in Romans 5:8: "But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."
	Faith and Repentance: Salvation is received through faith in Christ and repentance from sin. Repentance is the first step towards the forgiveness of the sins as expressed in the verse Acts 3:19: "Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord." and by keeping faith in Christ our savior as said in Acts 16:31: "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household."
	Justification: Through salvation, believers are declared righteous before God. As said in the verse Romans 5:1: "Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."
	Sanctification: Salvation initiates the lifelong process of becoming more like Christ as quoted in 1 Thessalonians 5:23: "May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through."

4.	The Ordinances of the Church:
The AG recognizes two ordinances: Water Baptism and Holy Communion (also called the Lord's Supper).
Baptism is a sacrament or ordinance in which a believer is immersed in water as a public declaration of their faith in Jesus Christ. The Church practices baptism by full immersion in water, believing this best symbolizes the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. As mentioned in Romans 6:3-4: "Or don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life." Baptism is seen as an outward expression of an inward spiritual reality. It symbolizes:
	Cleansing from sin 
	Identification with Christ's death, burial, and resurrection 
	Initiation into the body of Christ (the Church)
	Command of Christ: Baptism is viewed as a command of Christ for all believers as mentioned in Matthew 28:19: "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."
	Distinct from Spirit Baptism: Water baptism is distinct from the baptism in the Holy Spirit, which is another important doctrine in the church.

Holy Communion is the regular partaking of bread and wine (or grape juice) in remembrance of Christ's death. Bread represents Christ's body, and wine/juice represents His blood. As quoted in 1 Corinthians 11:23-25 - "The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, 'This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.' In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.'" All believers are encouraged to participate, regardless of denominational affiliation.
The Church typically observes communion regularly, often weekly or monthly, though frequency can vary by congregation.
	Significance: It serves as a memorial of Christ's sacrifice, a symbol of Christian unity, and a time for self-examination and renewal of faith as quoted in 1 Corinthians 11:26 - "For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes."
	Spiritual Presence: The Church believes in the real spiritual presence of Christ in communion, but not in the literal transformation of the elements (transubstantiation).

5.	Baptism in the Holy Spirit:
The Baptism in the Holy Spirit is understood as a separate and subsequent experience to salvation, where believers are filled with the Holy Spirit, empowering them for Christian life and service. The Baptism in the Holy Spirit is a distinct experience.
	Purpose: The primary purpose of this baptism is to empower believers for Christian witness to everyone around us and service as mentioned in Acts 1:8: "But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."
	Initial Physical Evidence: The initial physical evidence of the Baptism in the Holy Spirit is speaking in tongues. As we can see in Acts 2:4: "All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.
	Available to All Believers: This experience is believed to be available to all believers who seek it. As we can see in Acts 2:38-39: "Peter replied, 'Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off—for all whom the Lord our God will call.'" 
	Not a One-Time Event: While the initial baptism is a distinct experience, believers are encouraged to continually be filled with the Spirit. We are encouraged to be filled with Holy Spirit and renewing it as said in Ephesians 5:18: "Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit."
	Results of the Baptism: The baptism of Holy Spirit results in: 
	Power for witness and service 
	A deeper worship experience 
	Greater sensitivity to spiritual things 
	The manifestation of spiritual gifts
	Seeking the Baptism: Believers are encouraged to earnestly seek this baptism through prayer and faith as said in Luke 11:13: "If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!"

6.	Sanctification:
Sanctification in the Church doctrine is understood as a process of continuous spiritual growth and transformation after a person has been saved. It's the ongoing work of becoming more Christ-like in character and conduct. The Church views sanctification as both instantaneous (at the moment of salvation) and progressive (continuing throughout a believer's life). Key aspects of this doctrine include:
	Initial Sanctification: This occurs at the moment of salvation when a believer is set apart for God's purpose. As the verse says: 1 Corinthians 6:11 - "And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God."
	Progressive Sanctification: This is the ongoing process of growing in holiness and Christlikeness. As the verse says: 2 Corinthians 3:18 - "And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit."
	Cooperation with the Holy Spirit: Believers are called to actively participate in their sanctification. As the verse says: Philippians 2:12-13 - "Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure."
	Pursuit of Holiness: Sanctification involves striving for holiness in all aspects of life. As the verse says: 1 Peter 1:15-16 - "But as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, since it is written, 'You shall be holy, for I am holy.'"
	Lifelong Process: Sanctification is not completed in this life but continues until glorification. As the verse says: 1 Thessalonians 5:23-24 - "Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. He who calls you is faithful; he will surely do it."

7.	The Church and its mission:
This doctrine focuses on the nature and purpose of the church. I'll break it down into subpoints with relevant Bible verses:
	The Church as the Body of Christ: The church is made up of all believers in Jesus Christ as said in1 Corinthians 12:27 - "Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it."
	Unity of Believers: All believers are united in Christ, regardless of background as said in Galatians 3:28 - "There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus."
	The Church's Mission: Evangelism: The church is called to spread the Gospel to all people as said in Matthew 28:19-20 - "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you."
	The Church's Mission: Worship: The church exists to worship and glorify God as said in Colossians 3:16 - "Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts."
	The Church's Mission: Discipleship: The church is responsible for nurturing and developing believers as said in Ephesians 4:11-12 - "So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up."
	The Church's Mission: Service: The church is called to serve others and meet needs in Jesus' name as said in Galatians 6:10 - "Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers."
	Spiritual Gifts in the Church: God empowers believers with spiritual gifts to serve the church and fulfill its mission as said in 1 Peter 4:10 - "Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God's grace in its various forms."
	The Church as God's Instrument: God uses the church to accomplish His purposes on earth as said in Ephesians 3:10 - "His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms."

	Qualifications for Leadership: Leaders must meet specific moral and spiritual qualifications as said in 1 Timothy 3:2-3 - "Now the overseer is to be above reproach, faithful to his wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money."
	Purpose of Ministry: The primary purpose of ministry is to equip believers for service as said in Ephesians 4:12-13 - "to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ."
	Servant Leadership: Ministers are called to serve, not to be served as said in Mark 10:43-44 - "Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all."
	Accountability: Ministers are accountable to God and to the church as said in Hebrews 13:17 - "Have confidence in your leaders and submit to their authority, because they keep watch over you as those who must give an account."
	Empowerment by the Holy Spirit: Effective ministry relies on the power of the Holy Spirit as said in Acts 1:8 - "But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."

9.	The Blessed Hope:
The Blessed Hope refers to the rapture of the Church at Christ's return. This doctrine is centered on the anticipation of Jesus Christ's second coming and the gathering of believers to meet Him. Here's a more detailed breakdown with subpoints and Bible verses:
	The Promise of Christ's Return: Jesus promised He would come again as said in John 14:3 - "And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am."

So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him."
	The Purifying Effect of this Hope: The anticipation of Christ's return should motivate holy living as said in 1 John 3:2-3 - "Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will has not yet been made known. But we know that when Christ appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. All who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as he is pure."

10.	The Millennial Reign of Christ:

	Resurrected Saints Ruling with Christ: Believers will participate in Christ's rule as said in Revelation 20:6 - "Blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection. The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years."
	Characteristics of the Millennial Kingdom
